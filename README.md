Hi, I’m Ankit Anand.

I’m a builder focused on decentralized systems, AI-driven products and real-world financial infrastructure. I learn by building and I build with the intention that systems should work outside demos.

4× 🏆 Hackathon   
Areas I enjoy working in: Web3 payments, Backend systems, Frontend and product-focused engineering.
