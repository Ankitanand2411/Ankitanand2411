Hi, I’m Ankit Anand.

I’m a builder focused on decentralized systems, AI-driven products, and real-world financial infrastructure. I learn by building, and I build with the intention that systems should work outside demos.

🏆 4× Hackathon Winner  
Areas I enjoy working in: AI agents, Web3 payments, backend systems, and product-focused engineering.
